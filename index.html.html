    <p>Sisig, a popular Filipino dish made from chopped pig's face and ears, seasoned with calamansi (Philippine lime), onions, and chili peppers, has its roots in Pampanga. Here's a bit more about sisig's connection to Pampanga:</p>
    <p>Origins: Sisig is believed to have originated in Angeles City, Pampanga, particularly in a restaurant called Aling Lucing's Sisig. It was invented by Lucia "Aling Lucing" Cunanan in the 1970s. Originally, sisig was just a byproduct of grilling pork masks, cheeks, and heads, but Aling Lucing transformed it into the sizzling and flavorful dish that it is today.</p>
